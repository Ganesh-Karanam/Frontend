    <!-- Blog Post
Tag: HTML

You've been provided with a blog post as raw text, and you need to convert this post into a properly marked-up HTML
file.

The post should have a primary heading of Introducing AlgoCoin with a tagline of The future of decentralized meme
currency is here..

The post should be treated as an article with two sections, titled What is AlgoCoin? and Where Do I Start?,
respectively. Each section should have a paragraph of text (the text directly below the respective section title in
the starting code), and the sections should be divided by a horizontal rule.

In the first section, the text proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm should be marked up as strong text,
and Web 4.0 should be emphasized. In the second section, the word AlgoExpert should be a link to
https://algoexpert.io, and it should open in a new tab.

Finally, the post should have a footer at the bottom with the text Copyright 3022 AlgoCoin. All rights reserved..

Your HTML code should use proper semantic markup.

Content for the sections can be found below:
AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary proof-of-inverted-binary-tree
 consensus algorithm that will absolutely transform the way
  we think about currency and catapult the metaverse to its next major 
  stage: Web 4.0. Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of hoarding capital
   in wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time of usage
    through our unique point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree equates
     to one AlgoCoin. This means if your chicken tenders cost 420 AlgoCoin, 
     all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees. -->

           Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list.
           We recommend starting out by practicing on <a href="https://algoexpert.io" target="_blank">AlgoExpert</a>.
